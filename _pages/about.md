# Too technical to be artists, too creative to be engineers. That's the curse of researchers in graphics and TAs.

Hello! My name is **Elena**, and I am a computer graphics enthusiast.

I am currently working as a [**postdoctoral research scientist**](https://medialab.dei.unipd.it/members/elena-camuffo/) at the **University of Padova**, leading research in **Computer Vision**, particularly on **foundational deep learning** and **3D Gaussian splatting**.
Parallely, I am studying **Technical Art** attending a [**Houdini**](projects) course.

### üéì Research & Academic Path

After earning my **M.Sc. in TLC Engineering** in 2021, I did a **Ph.D. in Information Engineering** at the University of Padova, where I focused on **visual representations for scene understanding**.
During my Ph.D., I:

- Published [**over 10 papers**](publications) in international conferences and journals  
(*SIGGRAPH, ICASSP, ICIP, IROS, TMM*, etc.),
- Spent several months at **Samsung Research UK**, where I co-authored two papers and contributed to a **patent**,
- Supervised graduate theses, and supported teaching across several [**Master‚Äôs courses**](publications),
- Contributed to applied projects in **XR**, **education**, and **interdisciplinary research**.

### üé® Creative Technology & Digital Arts

Alongside my academic work, I‚Äôve always been drawn to the **creative side of technology**.  
In 2024, I attended the [**BigRock Master in Computer Graphics**](portfolio), where I honed my skills in **digital art**, **real-time rendering**, and **storytelling**, using tools like **Maya**, **ZBrush**, and **Unreal Engine**.

### üöÄ Vision & Future Goals

I see myself at the intersection of **research**, **creative technologies**, and **education**.  
I‚Äôm passionate about building systems that can **perceive and interact** with the world ‚Äî but also about designing **intuitive, expressive experiences** that make complex technologies more accessible.  
I‚Äôm especially interested in projects that combine **AI**, **vision**, and **graphics** whether in **academia**, **R&D**, or the **creative industry**.
