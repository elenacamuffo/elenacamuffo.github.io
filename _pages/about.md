# Too technical to be an artist. Too creative to be an engineer. I chose to be a Researcher in Graphics.

I‚Äôm **Elena Camuffo**, a researcher in **Computer Vision** and **3D visual understanding**, currently working as a [**postdoctoral research scientist**](https://medialab.dei.unipd.it/members/elena-camuffo/) at the **University of Padova**.  
My work lies at the intersection of **deep learning**, **3D vision**, and **graphics technologies**, with a strong focus on developing models that can perceive, reconstruct, and interact with the 3D world.

### üéì Research & Academic Path

After earning my **Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Engineering** in 2021, I began a **Ph.D. in Information Engineering** at the University of Padova, where I focused on **multi-modal learning strategies for scene understanding**.  
During my Ph.D., I:

- Published [**over 10 papers**](publications) in international conferences and journals  
(*SIGGRAPH, ICASSP, ICIP, IROS, TMM*, etc.),
- Spent several months at **Samsung Research UK**, where I co-authored two papers and contributed to a **patent**,
- Supervised graduate theses, and supported teaching across several **Master‚Äôs courses**,
- Contributed to applied projects in **XR**, **education**, and **interdisciplinary research**.

### üé® Creative Technology & Digital Arts

Alongside my academic work, I‚Äôve always been drawn to the **creative side of technology**.  
In 2024, I attended the [**BigRock Master in Computer Graphics**](portfolio), where I honed my skills in **digital art**, **real-time rendering**, and **storytelling**, using tools like **Maya**, **ZBrush**, and **Unreal Engine**.

### üöÄ Vision & Future Goals

I see myself at the intersection of **research**, **creative technology**, and **education**.  
I‚Äôm passionate about building systems that can **perceive and interact** with the world ‚Äî but also about designing **intuitive, expressive experiences** that make complex technologies more accessible.  
I‚Äôm especially interested in projects that combine **AI**, **vision**, and **graphics** whether in **academia**, **R&D**, or the **creative industry**.
