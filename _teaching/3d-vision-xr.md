## Topics Covered

### 3D Vision
- Fundamentals of 3D reconstruction
- Depth sensing and stereo vision

### Extended Reality
- Core concepts of virtual and augmented reality
- Interaction methods in XR environments

### Unity Development
- Unity project setup
- Creating XR applications

This course equips graduate students with foundational knowledge and advanced concepts in 3D computer vision and XR. It combines theoretical learning with hands-on Unity projects to develop skills in depth perception, spatial computing, and immersive technologies.

## Hands-On Labs

The [3DVisionXRLabs-Unity GitHub repository](https://github.com/elenacamuffo/3DVisionXRLabs-Unity.git)<i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> offers modular Unity-based labs that complement the course. These labs allow students to:

- Simulate stereo camera setups and explore epipolar geometry.
- Conduct virtual calibration using synthetic environments.
- Design interactive AR/VR applications leveraging computer vision techniques.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, students will:

- Implement 3D vision algorithms in immersive and interactive contexts.
- Create XR prototypes that integrate depth, motion, and geometry.
- Bridge computer vision research with real-time immersive experiences.
