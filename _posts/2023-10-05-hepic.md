The HePIC dataset is a comprehensive collection of information about heritage buildings. It aims to document and preserve the architectural and cultural significance of historical structures. The dataset includes detailed metadata, photographs, and structural information, making it a valuable resource for researchers, historians, and conservationists.

## Why HePIC Matters

Heritage buildings are an essential part of our cultural identity. By cataloging these structures, the HePIC dataset helps ensure their stories and significance are not lost to time.

## Features of the Dataset

- **Rich Metadata**: Includes historical context, architectural details, and geographical information.
- **High-Quality Images**: Provides visual documentation for analysis and preservation.
- **Open Access**: Encourages collaboration and research by making the dataset publicly available.

## Applications

The HePIC dataset can be used for:

- Academic research on historical architecture.
- Developing restoration plans for aging structures.
- Educating the public about cultural heritage.

Preserving our past is crucial for understanding our future, and the HePIC dataset plays a vital role in this mission.
